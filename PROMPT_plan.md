0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the application specifications.
0b. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present) to understand the plan so far.
0c. Study `src/lib/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to understand shared utilities & components.
0d. For reference, the application source code is in `src/*`.
0e. Study `data/*` to understand product content, sales copy, email sequences, and funnel configuration. This is the source of truth for all product data, pricing, copy, and campaign assets. Do NOT modify files in `data/` — use them as reference to create `src/data/*.ts` TypeScript exports.

1. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (if present; it may be incorrect) and use up to 500 Sonnet subagents to study existing source code in `src/*` and compare it against `specs/*`. Use an Opus subagent to analyze findings, prioritize tasks, and create/update @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md as a bullet point list sorted in priority of items yet to be implemented. Ultrathink. Consider searching for TODO, minimal implementations, placeholders, skipped/flaky tests, and inconsistent patterns. Study @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to determine starting point for research and keep it up to date with items considered complete/incomplete using subagents.

IMPORTANT: Plan only. Do NOT implement anything. Do NOT assume functionality is missing; confirm with code search first. Treat `src/lib` as the project's standard library for shared utilities and components. Prefer consolidated, idiomatic implementations there over ad-hoc copies.

ULTIMATE GOAL: Build a high-converting Spanish-language sales page for the "Pack de 275+ Prompts IA para Marketing y Negocios" — a EUR 27 digital product. The Astro site serves as the sales funnel entry point: Google Ads traffic → long-form sales page (from data/sales-funnel/) → CTA to Systeme.io checkout. Site hosts a thank-you page with product access instructions. Target: >3% conversion rate, >30% order bump take rate, ACV EUR 48 at CPA < EUR 25. Mobile-first, GDPR/LOPD compliant, GA4+GTM cross-domain tracking, Product+FAQPage JSON-LD. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the specification at specs/FILENAME.md. If you create a new element then document the plan to implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.
